This is a folder containing all of the Codeforces problems I complete that are not a part of a contest. Some of the problems completed are part of a challenge where I try to meet a quota in a specific amount of time or keep a streak going. You can see them below.

## 2021 Every Day Challenge
This challenge is a fairly "low-key" challenge as all I want to do 2-3 problems a day as I start working on USACO more and more. Note though that this is not a Summer Challenge as I want to continue this through the school year.

Current Streak: **0** day(s)

## Summer 2021 Streak Challenge
This is a challenge to do 6 Codeforces problems a day as long as I can. 

My plan for this one is to do the problems in a pattern: easy-easy-med-med-easy-hard, where each difficulty is a difficulty rating on codeforces.

Current Easy Difficulty: 800

Current Med Difficulty: 900

Current Hard Difficulty: 1000

Current Streak: **1** day(s)

Past Streaks

- 6/30/2021 - 7/1/2021 (2 days)
- 7/6/2021 - 7/7/2021 (2 days)
- 7/9/2021 - 7/11/2021 (3 days)

Scrapping this one to have more time to dive deeper in to DSA and use the USACO website more.

## Summer 2021 1000 Challenge
This was a challenge to get to 1000 problems by the end of the summer. However, I ended up scrapping the idea due to restructuring my priorities.
