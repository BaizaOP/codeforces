This is a folder containing all of the Codeforces problems I complete that are not a part of a contest. Some of the problems completed are part of a challenge where I try to meet a quota in a specific amount of time or keep a streak going. You can see them below.

# Challenges

[Summer 2021 Streak Challenge](#summer-2021-streak-challenge) (6/29/2021 to ?)

[Summer 2021 1000 Challenge](#summer-2021-1000-challenge) (6/10/2021 to 6/12/2021)


## Summer 2021 Streak Challenge
This is a challenge to do 6 Codeforces problems a day as long as I can. 

My plan for this one is to do the problems in a pattern: easy-easy-med-med-easy-hard, where each difficulty is a difficulty rating on codeforces.

Current Easy Difficulty: 800

Current Med Difficulty: 900

Current Hard Difficulty: 1000

Current Streak: **0** day(s)

Past Streaks
6/30/2021 - 7/1/2021 (2 days)

## Summer 2021 1000 Challenge
This was a challenge to get to 1000 problems by the end of the summer. However, I ended up scratching the idea due to restructuring my priorities.
